# pd-wmh
Comparison of four automated white matter hyperintensity (WMH) segmentation algorithms to n=40 gold standard, maually traced WMH maps. We then applied all four methods to a large group of Parkinson's disease patients and healthy controls to investigate the relationship among segmentation algorithm, WMH volume, and cognitive decline in PD.

WMH_Xsec_analysis.Rmd is the analysis script. 

dat_base_anon.csv & performance_measures_anon.csv are the raw data files.
